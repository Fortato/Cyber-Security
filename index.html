    Evidence of the cybersecurity workforce shortage continues to mount: By 2022, there will be 1.8 million open jobs in
    this field, according to the recent Global Information Security Workforce Study. This is up from the 2015 estimate
    of 1.5 million by 2020.
    "The numbers are going in the wrong direction," said<br> Wesley Simpson, COO of ISC(2), of the study, which surveyed
    19,000 cyber security professionals. "It's a huge concern to organizations as well as people in this profession."

    </table>
    One major reason for the shortage? Millennials aren't going into the field. Only 7% of cyber security workers
    surveyed were under age 29, and 13% were between ages 30 and 34. The average age of cyber professionals is 42,
    Simpson said. "Over the next 10 years, we will have a large population of cyber professionals starting to retire,"
    Simpson said. "We don't have a good plan to backfill those large numbers of folks starting to leave the industry. We
    need to be able to educate and bring awareness to all facets of cyber security, and send a message that regardless
    of if you have a technical degree or not, it's a great, diverse, lucrative career for folks to get into."

          The reason it's difficult to attract millennials to the field is largely due to their lack of awareness,
          Simpson
          said. Cyber security is often not on the radar of young children as a potential career, or as being different
          from
          general IT work.
          <hr>"This is a field in great demand, with 2% unemployment globally, and an average salary of about
          $100,000. We're not doing a good job educating folks about it," said Simpson.

    While computer science occupations are growing, the college graduation rates in the United States for STEM-related
    degrees are one of the lowest ratios of bachelor’s degrees in the world. According to the U.S. Department of
    Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 48 percent of beginning bachelor’s degree students in STEM
    fields left their field before graduating. We do not want Folsom High students to be part of these statistics.

    The Alliance for California Computing Education for Students and Schools (ACCESS) cites that 9 out of 10 high school
    students will not get any computer science skills before they graduate from high school. With the call for national
    efforts to improve STEM-related performance, the High School Career department will be
    focusing on aligning a K-12 computer science education with college-level degree programs, providing a rigorous
    computer science education to meet the demands of these computer science and STEM-related job openings and to
    compete in a global economy.

    have been tracking the cybersecurity labor shortage for at least a decade". Not only does this show that even
    experts are looking for others to work in this career, but that their are many open positions for thousands to take.
